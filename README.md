## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques

- **Microsoft Excel**
  - Power Query for data cleaning and transformation
  - Pivot Tables for analysis
  - Filters and charts for data visualization

## 📊 Key Findings

After cleaning and analyzing the data:

- **Casual riders** use bikes **more frequently on weekends**, indicating leisure or recreational usage.
- **Annual members** prefer riding on **weekdays**, especially during **peak hours (4 PM to 7 PM)**, suggesting usage for commuting.
- **Annual Membership riders have significantly higher usage on weekdays** compared to casual riders during those peak hours.
- **Bike type preferences differ by user group**:
  - **Members** primarily use **classic bikes** and **electric bikes**.
  - **Casual riders** show higher usage of **electric scooters**.

## 💡 Recommendations

Since casual riders are primarily weekend users and prefer electric scooters:

- **Avoid offering standard annual memberships to casual users immediately**.
- Instead, introduce **flexible plans**, such as:
  - **Weekly passes**
  - **Monthly memberships**
  - **Weekend-only plans**
- Promote **electric scooters with weekend passes** to match casual riders' preferences.
- Provide **incentives or trial periods** for casual riders to try classic/electric bikes, increasing familiarity and potential transition to full membership.
